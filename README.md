# NOCT
Nonlinear classification trees

In this project, we create the Nonlinear classification trees (NOCT) as a new type of ML model (To the best of our knowledge, no related work has been done before)

The NOCT can achieve the best accuracy in many UCI test datasets compared with all known single-classification trees. It also offers the potential for interpretability.
